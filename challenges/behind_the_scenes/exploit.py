# Password 'Itz_0nLy_UD2' found by reversing the binary in Ghidra
# The binary was slightly obfuscated. It registered a signal handler to
# override a SIGKILL signal and simply continue execution at the next
# instruction. It then had UD2 instructions scattered throughout that
# triggered the SIGKILL and simply jumped to the next instruction.
# Ghidra did not disassemble the instructions following the UD2s, obfuscating
# much of the code.
